            ASP.NET is a web development platform, which provides a programming model, a
            comprehensive software infrastructure and various services required to build
            up robust web applications for PC, as well as mobile devices.<br/>
           <br/>
            ASP.Net – This is used for developing web-based applications, which are made to run on
            any browser such as Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox. The Web application would be
            processed on a server, which would have Internet Information Services Installed. Internet
            Information Services or IIS is a Microsoft component which is used to execute an Asp.Net 
            application.
	    The result of the execution is then sent to the client machines, and the output is shown 
            in the browser.<br/>
       <br/>
            ASP.NET works on top of the HTTP protocol, and uses the HTTP commands and 
            policies to set a browser-to-server bilateral communication and cooperation.<br/>
            
            ASP.NET is a part of Microsoft .Net platform. ASP.NET applications are compiled 
            codes, written using the extensible and reusable components or objects present 
            in .Net framework. These codes can use the entire hierarchy of classes in 
            .Net framework.<br/>
                <br/>
           The ASP.NET application codes can be written in any of the following languages:
            	C#
            	Visual Basic.Net
            	Jscript
             	J#<br/>
        <br/>
           ASP.NET is used to produce interactive, data-driven web applications over the internet.
           It consists of a large number of controls such as text boxes, buttons, and labels for 
           assembling, configuring, and manipulating code to create HTML pages.
