           C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".
           It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.
           C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.
           The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.   <br/>

               C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to
               be reused, lowering development costs. As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for 
               programmers to switch to C# or vice versa   <br/>

            C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language pronounced as “C Sharp”. 
            It was developed by Microsoft led by Anders Hejlsberg and his team within the .NET 
            initiative and was approved by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and
            International Standards Organization (ISO).   <br/>
              <br/>
             C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure. C# is a lot similar to Java
             syntactically and is easy for users who have knowledge of C, C++ or Java.   <br/>

            Common Language Runtime (CLR) in C#<br/>

           CLR is the basic and Virtual Machine component of the .NET Framework. It is the run-time environment
           in the .NET Framework that runs the codes and helps in making the development process easier by
           providing the various services. Basically, it is responsible for managing the execution of .NET
           programs regardless of any .NET programming language. Internally, CLR implements the VES(Virtual 
           Execution System) which is defined in the Microsoft’s implementation of the CLI(Common Language 
           Infrastructure).    <br/>
              <br/>
           The code that runs under the Common Language Runtime is termed as the Managed Code. In other words,
           you can say that CLR provides a managed execution environment for the .NET programs by improving the
           security, including the cross language integration and a rich set of class libraries, etc. CLR is 
           present in every .NET framework version. Below table illustrate the CLR version in .NET framework
